# Quadrupled_Spider_Robot-4-legged walking robot
1)The Quadrupled Spider Robot is a four-legged walking robot inspired by the movement of spiders. It uses servo motors for each leg to achieve precise control and coordinated movement

2)The Adafruit PWM Servo Driver controller is used for managing multiple servo motors. The Spider Botâ€™s motion and functionality are achieved through a combination of trajectory planning, inverse kinematics, and the coordinated movement of its servo motors

3)Inverse kinematics is employed to calculate the required joint angles for the robot to achieve specific positions or motions. Trajectory planning involves determining the time series of successive joint angles for coordinated leg and body movements

4)The Spider Bot executes a sequence of leg movements, including lifting, swinging, and placing, to achieve forward motion. Coordinated movements of all legs are orchestrated to mimic the walking cycle
